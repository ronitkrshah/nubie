# Nubie

**WARNING: This Project Is Still In Alpha Release**

**A simple, decorator-based WebAPI framework for TypeScript.**  
Built on Express. Inspired by .NET. Designed to make backend development faster and cleaner.

---

## Overview

Nubie is a TypeScript WebAPI framework focused on **developer experience**.  
It’s not trying to be enterprise-ready—it’s trying to be **developer-friendly**.

With Nubie, you can build structured and maintainable APIs quickly using decorators, dependency injection, and built-in validation, without boilerplate or heavy configuration.

---

## Key Features

- **Decorator-based Controllers**  
  Define routes declaratively with clean, .NET-inspired syntax.

- **Parameter Binding**  
  Automatically map request parameters, query values, and request bodies.

- **Dependency Injection**  
  Built-in container for managing services and dependencies.

- **Validation Support**  
  Seamless integration with `class-validator` for request payload validation.

- **Authentication & Authorization**  
  Out-of-the-box support for JWT and role-based access.

- **Error Handling**  
  Consistent and extensible error responses for predictable APIs.

- **Minimal Boilerplate**  
  Express power with a fraction of the setup.

---

## Who Is Nubie For?

- Developers who want **structured APIs** without excessive configuration.
- Teams familiar with **.NET-style controllers** who prefer TypeScript/Express.
- Projects where **developer productivity** is more important than enterprise complexity.
- Anyone looking for a modern, **decorator-driven** approach to building APIs in Node.js.
