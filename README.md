# 🍼 Nubie

**A TypeScript WebAPI framework for nubs laik me.**  
For noobs, by a noob — but kinda gawd-tier.  
Built on Express. Inspired by .NET. Decoratorz. DI. Zero boilerplate. 100% chill.

---

## 🧠 What Even Is Nubie?

Nubie is a TypeScript WebAPI framework that:

- Lets u slap some decorators on classes and pretend you’re a backend ninja 🥷
- Does all the boring route-wiring for u (ur welcome)
- Has Dependency Injection so u can inject stuff like a pro (or at least fake it)
- Requires zero config, zero setup, zero willpower
- Helps u go from “huh?” to “hot damn that works??” in like 2 mins

---

## ✨ Features 4 Nubz

- `@ApiController`, `@HttpGet`, `@HttpPost`, etc — you just vibe with decorators 💅
- Auto-magic request handling — `@Param`, `@Body`, `@Query` do the thinking for u
- Built-in DI like a good lil framework should 💉
- No boilerplate, no clutter — just vibes
- Looks like pro code, feels like cheat codes 🧙‍♂️
- Built-in validation (so users stop sending `age: "banana"`)
- Built-in JWT Authentication (so users stop pretending to be admin with `Authorization: Bearer banana`)

---

## 🤖 Who Is This For?

- Nubs, dev gawds, burnt-out backenders, and everyone in between
- People who scream at Express boilerplate
- You, reading this README instead of doing actual work

---

## 🧃 How Does It Work?

U write a class.  
U add a decorator.  
U hit the endpoint.  
U cry happy tears. 😭

Basically:

- Controllers are just classes with a sprinkle of `@ApiController`
- Endpoints are just methods with a dash of `@HttpGet`, `@HttpPost`, etc.
- Parameters auto-magically appear in ur method like ✨woah✨
- Services can be injected with no tears

It's like magic but TypeScript and slightly cursed.

## 🗺️ Coming Soon™

- OpenAPI docs (flex on Postman nerds)
- Better error messages (lol maybe)
