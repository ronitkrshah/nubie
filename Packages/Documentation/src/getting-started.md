# Getting Started

Nubie is a small TypeScript WebAPI framework designed to simplify backend development.
Built on Express and inspired by the structure of .NET WebAPI, Nubie introduces a clean, decorator-based approach to building APIs with minimal configuration and maximum clarity.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v20 or later recommended)
- `npm` or `yarn` as your package manager
- Basic knowledge of **TypeScript**

## Installation
Install `nubie-cli` to bootstrap a new project
